Client
======

To run any queries, the first step is to construct a client.

The library offers both synchronous and asynchronous clients.

.. autoclass:: postgrest_py.AsyncPostgrestClient
    :members:
    :inherited-members:

.. autoclass:: postgrest_py.SyncPostgrestClient
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
